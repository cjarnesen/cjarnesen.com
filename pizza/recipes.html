      <h2>Dough Recipes</h2>
      <h3>Basic dough ★★★☆☆</h3>
      <p>Makes (3) dough balls<br>
      500g flour (King Arthur '00')<br>
      300g warm water<br>
      12g salt<br>
      100g sourdough starter (or half a pack of dry yeast)</p>
      <p><strong>Directions:</strong><br>
      Add warm water to mixing bowl<br>
      Add salt to water and mix to dissolve<br>
      Add 50 g of flour and mix<br>
      Add starter and blend into solution<br>
      Add remaining flour (450g)</p>
      <p>Mix on kitchen aid stand mixer with dough hook for 4min<br>
      Remove dough from bowl and place in rising container (plastic bread bucket is what I use) let sit for 90-120min to rise<br>
      Remove dough onto floured surface and cut into 3 equal sizes<br>
      Weigh out each dough ball ~280g (on the larger side max I do is 315g) and place in a container (I use left over plastic gelato tubs)<br>
      Place in fridge for up to 5 days</p>
      <p><em>*note - the above process is simple... but yields only adequate dough.</em></p>

      <h3>CJ's (68%) dough ★★★★★</h3>
      <p>Makes (5) medium dough balls<br>
      635 g flour (King Arthur '00')<br>
      409 g warm water<br>
      16 g salt<br>
      150 g sourdough starter (or half a pack of dry yeast)</p>
      <p><strong>Directions:</strong><br>
      Add warm water to mixing bowl<br>
      Add salt to water and mix to dissolve<br>
      Add 135 g of flour and mix<br>
      Add starter and blend into solution<br>
      Add remaining flour (500g)</p>
      <p>Mix on kitchen aid stand mixer with dough hook for 2min<br>
      Wrap bowl opening and let dough sit in oven with oven light on for 45min<br>
      Mix dough for 10min on high speed in stand mixer (make sure to watch the mixer, it will walk around the counter)<br>
      Remove bowl and wrap again and let sit in oven for 90-120min to rise<br>
      Remove dough onto floured surface and prep olive oil bowls for each dough ball (5 in this case)<br>
      Weigh out each dough ball ~240g and place in bowl<br>
      Once dough is weighed, plop dough on cutting board and work into a ball<br>
      Place each dough ball back in olive oil bowl and wrap and place in fridge for up to 5 days</p>
      <p><em>*note - this process is a bit more involved, but it really brings the dough together! It is worth it!</em></p>
